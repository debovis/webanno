#summary In this page, already annotated documents may be checked, corrected and enhanced.

= Correction = 
== Preprocessing ==

Before being able to see and correct documents, make sure to have chosen _correction_ when creating your project in projects. The instruction to do so is on the following page: [http://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Projects]. Also make sure that the documents you upload are already annotated.

== Handling of Correction page ==
After clicking on the _Correction_ symbol on the main page, the Correction page is opened. In the appearing frame, which is the left one in the image below, the user has to choose a project first. 


Afterwards the documents assigned to him are displayed. Now he may choose a document. Just like in _Annotation_, the colour of the document names signals the following: black- unopened document, blue- opened document and red - document finished.
