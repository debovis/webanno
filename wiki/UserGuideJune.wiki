It is assumed that !WebAnno has been installed successfully. For issues regarding the installation, please see [http://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/InstallationGuide]. 

All materials, including this guide, is available via the project site: https://code.google.com/p/webanno/

<img src="https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/login.jpg" width="400"/>


== Overview screen ==

After login, you will be presented with the WebAnno overview screen. This screen can be reached at any time from within the GUI by clicking on the *Home* link in the left upper corner. 

Here, you can navigate to one of the currently three options:  
•  Annotation Page: The page to perform annotations 
•  Curation:  Merging  multiple  annotations  (not  available  to  mere 
annotators) 
•  Projects:  The  page  to  set  up  or  change  annotation 
projects (not available to mere annotators)
•   Monitoring: Allows you to see the projects, their progress and change documentstatus


Please click on the functionality you need. The individual functionalities will be explained in further chapters.

Here, you can navigate to one of the currently three options: 
  * *Annotation* - The page to perform annotations
  * *Curation* -  Compare and merge annotations from multiple users (only for _curators_)
  * *Projects* - Set up or change annotation projects (only for _administrators_)
  * *Monitoring* - Allows you to see the projects, their progress and change documentstatus (only for _administrators_ and _curators)

== Annotation ==

When navigating to the *Annotation* page, a dialogue opens that allows you to select a project, and a document within the project. If you want to open a different project or document later, click on *Open* button to open the dialog.

<img src="https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/annotation1.jpg" width="800"/>

Projects appear as folders, and contain the documents of the project. Double-click on a document to open it for annotation. 
Once the document is opened, a default of 10 sentences are loaded on the annotation  page.  The  *Settings*  button will  allow  you  to specify the display window size as well as select the annotation layers to be used. For Example, for NER annotation, select the options as shown below (red check mark):

<img src="https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/annotation2.jpg" width="400"/>

Sentence  numbers  on  the  left  side  of  the  annotation  page  shows  the  exact sentence numbers in the document. 

<img src="https://webanno.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/annotation3.jpg" width="400"/>

The arrow buttons *first page*, *next page*, *previous page*, *last page*, and *go to page* allow you to navigate accordingly. The “Prev.” and “Next” buttons in the “Document” frame allow you to go to the previous or next document on your project list. 
Annotations are always immediately persistent in the backend database. Thus, it is not necessary to  save the annotations explicitly. Also, losing the connection through network issues or timeouts does not cause data loss. To obtain a local copy of the current document, click on *export* button . The document will be saved in TCF to your local disk, and can be re-imported via adding the document to a project by a project administrator. Please export your data periodically, at least when finishing a document or not continuing annotations for an extended period of time. 
A click on the “Help” Button displays the Guidelines for the tool and “The Annotator's Guide to NER-Annotation”.
When you are finished with annotating or curating a document, please click on the “Done” 
button      , so that the document may be further processed.

Link annotations (between POS tags) are created by selecting the starting POS-tag, then dragging the arrow to connect it to its target POS tag. All possible targets are highlighted. 

== Curation ==
When navigating to the “Curation Page”, the procedure for opening projects and documents is the same as in “Annotation”.  The “Page” navigation is also equivalent to “Annotation”.

In the left frame of the window, named “Sentences”, the sentences of the chosen document are displayed. The ones shaded in red created a conflict in annotation.

The frame called “Merged” shows the result of the default merge the conflicting annotations. Below, the annotated sentences are shown in separate frames, entitled with the annotators logins. By double-clicking on the annotation of an annotator's frame, you select his annotation to in the merged sentence. The sentence in the merged frame can be treated like a sentence in the “Annotation”. By selecting a word with a click you are able to produce new annotations, by clicking on an annotation, you are able to change its classification or delete it.
