#summary Standalone Installation

All-in-one version which does not require a database server or tomcat to be set up.

Get the standalone jar from the [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/downloads/list downloads] and start it with: 
{{{
java -Xmx1g -Dwebanno.home=/my/webanno/home -jar webanno-XXX-standalone.jar
}}}

Mind to replace `/my/webanno/home` with the full path (not relative path!) of a folder where WebAnno can store its data.

By default the server starts on port 8080 an you can access it via a browser at http://localhost:8080 after you started it. You can add the parameter `--httpPort=9999` at the end of the command line to start the server on port 9999 (or choose any other port).

A full list of the command line parameters can be found here: http://winstone.sourceforge.net/#commandLine

You can start with the SampleProjects to explore some of the functionalities. 

*Note:* If you have previously used an older version of the WebAnno standalone, make sure to clean up the temporary installation before running the new version:

   * On OS X: `rm -R "$TMPDIR/winstoneEmbeddedWAR"`
   * On Linux: `rm -R /tmp/winstoneEmbeddedWAR`
   * On Windows: remove the `winstoneEmbeddedWAR` that should be somewhere under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`
