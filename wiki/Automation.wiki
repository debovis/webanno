#summary Describes the functionality of automated annotation

= Automation =
This functionality gives the possibility to choose features and documents, which can be used for training of all layers that are offered in WebAnno (lemma, NER, POS and co-ref).

== Create an Automation Project ==
After clicking on "Create Project" on the Project Page, select "automation" as your project type. The detailled description may be found in the [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Projects Project chapter].

The documents, that are to be annotated, have to be uploaded in the frame "Documents". Please make sure that the chosen format corresponds to the format of the files you are uploading.

To manage the automation process, choose the Automation frame. Click on "Create template" in the "Templates" frame to create a model for your automated annotation.

Two new windows shall now pop up. "Feature selection" allows you to choose the features that you want your template to have.

In the first sub-frame called "Morphological features", you may select between different n-grams and capitalization. The second frame provides the possibility to select the feature of word n-grams (left in the frame) and label n-grams (right in the frame). Both features regard the preceding tokens of the current token.
In the third frame, one may select Automation Preferences. By selecting the limit of prediction staying on this page, you may limit the amount of autmated sentences. Next, one has to specify the layer to be trained. The feature below allows to choose annotations of other layers as feature for training the current layer. By ticking the feature below, you select the option to predict labels based on your annotations. After selecting the desired features, press "Save template".

Now training documents for the automation may be uploaded. Please take care of having the labels, which you have chosen as features in the previous step, present.

Also, the documents need to be formatted like WebAnno outputs annotated docs.

Select the format of documents that you want to upload, click on "Select document" and select the document, then click "Import".

After having selected all features, click on "Start" in the "Automation/Prediction" frame.
