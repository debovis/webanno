#summary Describes the functionality of automated annotation. Will be accessible soon.

= Automation =
This functionality gives the possibility to choose features and documents, which can be used for training of all layers that are offered in WebAnno (lemma, NER, POS and co-ref).

== Create an Automation Project ==
After clicking on "Create Project" on the Project Page, select "automation" as your project type. The detailled description may be found in the [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Projects Project chapter].

The documents, that are to be annotated, have to be uploaded in the frame "Documents". Please make sure that the chosen format corresponds to the format of the files you are uploading.

To manage the automation process, choose the Automation frame. The following frame will appear:

First choose your target layer in the "Select automation layer" frame.
If you want to train a non-custom layer, please make sure you created or imported it in the Layer frame (for instructions to do so, see [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Projects#New_Layer_Creation New Layer Creation]).

The following frame will appear in the right frame:

It gives you the possibility to decide, whether annotations chosen later on on the Automation page will be automatically changed to this annotation or not. After choosing this feature, the following frame will be displayed:

Here you may choose the format of the target layer and optionally add some feature layers on which you want to train.

In the tab "Target layer" you may upload training files containing the target layer in WebAnno Export formats (WebAnno CPH TEI reader, plain text, binary format, XMI format, old WebAnno Format, WebAnno Format, Weblicht TCF Format, for more information on these formats, see [Format https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Format?ts=1407336468&updated=Format]). 

In the next tab "TAB-SEP target", you may upload training files containing the target layer in a tab-separated format, which is structured by writing each single word in a line together with its target tag, separated by a tab. Sentences are separated by blank lines. 

An example of such a file is presented below.

The same goes analogically for the feature layers. The "Other layers" tab gives the possiblity to upload WebAnno Export formats and choosing the layers that are to be used in training in the format window. The "TAB-SEP feature" tab gives the possiblity to upload files in the above described tab-separated format, containing the feature tags in the second column. Every file will be regarded as one separate feature.

After choosing the training files, uploading them in the right format and importing them (by clicking on "Import"), every file will be displayed in the corresponding tab in the frame "Documents". Click on the button "Start Automation" on the left, when you have uploaded your training data. Be prepared to wait for some time, as automation is a non-trivial process.
