== Create an Automation Project ==
After clicking on "Create Project" on the Project Page, select "automation" as your project type. The detailled description may be found in the [https://code.google.com/p/webanno/wiki/Projects Project chapter].

The documents, that are to be annotated, have to be uploaded in the frame "Documents". Please make sure that the chosen format corresponds to the format of the files you are uploading.
